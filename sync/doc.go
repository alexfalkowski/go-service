// Package sync provides synchronization helpers and wrappers used by go-service.
//
// This package re-exports a small subset of synchronization primitives and types, including a generic Map and a
// buffer pool backed by the external `github.com/alexfalkowski/go-sync` package, and mutex types from the standard
// library `sync` package.
