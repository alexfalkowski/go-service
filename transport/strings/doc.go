// Package strings provides string helpers used by transport packages in go-service.
//
// This package mostly re-exports helpers from `github.com/alexfalkowski/go-service/v2/strings` and adds a few
// transport-specific helpers such as ignore checks for common endpoints and gRPC full method parsing.
