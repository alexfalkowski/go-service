// Package runtime provides helpers for interacting with and observing the Go runtime.
//
// This package groups small utilities used across go-service for runtime-related concerns
// such as configuration, metrics, or environment-derived behavior.
//
// Start with exported `Config` types and `New*` constructors (when present).
